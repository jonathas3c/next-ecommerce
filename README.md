First Of all, this project is live at [this website](https://nextsanityecommerce.jonathas.dev). But feel free to browse the project if you want.
This project aims to serve as a POC for similar projects that share common features with this one (as for example my [personal website](https://desapega.jonathas.dev) for organizing the items I don't need anymore and I'm selling, currently on maintenance). But the project is completely extensible and modifiable. Feel free to clone and change whatever you would like.

In case you want to simulate a test purchase: use the following test details for the credit card:

- Card number: 4242 4242 4242 4242
- CVV: 424
- Valid thru: 04/24
- Name on Card: You can put any name in here

** THIS CARD IS GENERATED BY STRIPE FOR TEST PURPOSES, SO THIS WON'T BE VALID FOR REAL PURCHASES :) **
